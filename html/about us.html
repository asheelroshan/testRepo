            We, at Futura Labs, have observed that students coming out of college have no idea about the operations of the IT industry. To combat this vulnerability and make the freshers better understand the working environment of an IT company, Futura labs have simulated the Atmosphere where students receive employee-like treatment. This training helps them manage their work according to the standard criteria and discipline.
            
            The trainees also learn how to be punctual and how to respect deadlines. Above all, it teaches them how they must behave with their colleagues.
